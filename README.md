# GAN Project : Iâ€™m Something of a Painter Myself
This project has been initiated to better understand the development and trianing of GAN Models

The two models will work against each other, with the generator trying to trick the discriminator, and the discriminator trying to accurately classify the real vs. generated images.


Style transfer is the technique of reconstructing images in the style of another image.

I have chosen to use Andy Warhol. Perosnally i like the use of his coolours, high contrast and deep saturation. Its somethingthat notonly sticks to art but can be a place in a home and make you think "that looks cool bruv".
